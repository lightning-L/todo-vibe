This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## PWA (Progressive Web App)

The app is installable as a PWA. After building and serving (e.g. `npm run build && npm run start`), you can add it to the home screen:

- **iOS Safari**: Open the site in Safari → tap the Share button → **Add to Home Screen** → name it and confirm.
- **Android Chrome**: Open the site in Chrome → tap the menu (⋮) → **Install app** or **Add to Home screen** → confirm.
